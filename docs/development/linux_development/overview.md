### Linux Development

We support the following local development setups

1. **[Export from prebuilt docker image](#local-linux-export)** (recommended), i.e. ue4-docker installed build - Builds in docker, then installs to your local system.

2. **[Run everything inside docker](/docs/development/linux_development/run-in-docker.md)** (promising, but not heavily used) -  Uses X11 forwarding view Unreal running in docker

3. **[Traditional](#local-linux-traditional)** (not recommended) - Run Unreal per the standard Epic instructions (Use this if you want to use an existing Unreal 4.21 installation)
